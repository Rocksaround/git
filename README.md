Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


Hii there.so i'd created this project with basic knowledge of HTML,CSS,BOOTSTRAP and SASS.
in this project i used 4 html pages linked through each other.in each page i've added some information stuff like about me
,my resume,contact me. i used the bootstrap class in my project though it is quite difficult to manage my styles
with bootstrap preloaded styles.i've fullfileed all the neccessary conditions and tried to make the best out of it.
it took my 5 continuous days in preparing this.i've faced many difficulties in it and the major one is responsiveness 
of my pages.so i request the invigilators to please help me figuring out this problem.
thank you!
